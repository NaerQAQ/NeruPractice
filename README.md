# Mochi (Neru Practice)

This project is a private project created for the Neru server, and it is still in development and not stable.

## Advantageous Design

These are the standout design elements we believe make Mochi superior.

### High-Performance Design

* Nearly Completely Asynchronous and Multithreaded Design
* Carefully Considered and Safety-Focused.

### High-Quality Code

* Annotating Repetitive Operations Instead of Lazily Copying Them.
