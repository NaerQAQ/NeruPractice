# Mochi (Neru Practice)

This project is a private project created for the Neru server, and it is still in development and not stable.

## Advantageous Design

These are the standout design elements we believe make Mochi superior.

### High-Performance Design

* Nearly Completely Asynchronous and Multithreaded Design
* Carefully Considered and Safety-Focused.

### High-Quality Code

* Annotating Repetitive Operations Instead of Lazily Copying Them.

### Scripting System

* Allows you to perform various operations using JavaScript scripts, and you can even customize the context.

## Future Updates and Development

Due to my ongoing health condition (mental health issues), updates to this project may not be as timely as desired. Please understand that all progress on Mochi is driven purely by personal interest and may occur at an irregular pace. Your patience and support are greatly appreciated. Thank you for being a part of this journey.
