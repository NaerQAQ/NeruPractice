# Mochi (Neru Practice)

This project is a private endeavor created for the Neru server, still in active development and currently unstable. It was open-sourced on November 10, 2023.

## Advantageous Design

These are the standout design elements we believe make Mochi superior.

### High-Performance Design

* Nearly Completely Asynchronous and Multithreaded Design
* Carefully Considered and Safety-Focused.

### High-Quality Code

* Annotating Repetitive Operations Instead of Lazily Copying Them.

### Scripting System

* Allows you to perform various operations using JavaScript scripts, and you can even customize the context.

## Future Updates and Development

Project updates may not be as timely as anticipated. Please understand that all progress on Mochi is purely driven by individual interest and may occur at irregular intervals. Thank you very much for your patience and support. We appreciate your involvement in this journey.

## Future Plans

Due to issues related to the NaerQAQ disease, the original development team has faced challenges, and no one within the team is willing to take on the project individually.

The project will now be taken over by _**zhusun890**_ and transformed into an open-source initiative.

## Current Available Content

Here, we will outline some potentially valuable aspects of the project for reference:

- Replicated features for the arena
- Fundamental script functionalities (listeners, thread scheduling, etc.)
- Implementation of some annotated basics
- Support for persistent storage (Json/Yaml/Toml)
- Implementation of some convenient utility functions
- and more.

## Contributions

We welcome developers to contribute code to this project and greatly appreciate your involvement.

Currently, there are no specified code style guidelines. However, we encourage you to leverage existing features and avoid duplicating efforts or refactoring functionalities to make them less efficient or harder to understand.

## Sponsors

During the initial stages, QwQTsuki (Neru Network) fully sponsored the development of NaerQAQ.
